# AutoML Model Comparison

This project explores **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)** using three different libraries:  
- **PyCaret**
- **Lazy Predict**
- **H2O AutoML**

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to compare multiple machine learning models automatically and evaluate their performance using different AutoML tools.

## 🚀 Tools & Libraries Used
- **PyCaret**: Simplifies the machine learning workflow and provides automated model selection and tuning.
- **Lazy Predict**: Quickly trains multiple models without extensive preprocessing.
- **H2O AutoML**: An advanced framework that performs automatic model selection and ensemble learning.

## 🔍 Results Summary
Each AutoML library was used to train and compare various models. The evaluation metrics include:
- **Accuracy / R² Score**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Area Under Curve (AUC)**
- **Training Time**

For detailed results, check the outputs in the project.
